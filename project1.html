            <h2>Aditya Pawar</h2>
            <p>
                I am Aditya, a passionate engineer with a degree in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai. I am
                keen to learn new technologies and have developed an interest in the fields of Web Development and Data
                Analytics.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my initial years of engineering, I had done an internship in Web Development from Suven
                Consultants and Technology Pvt. Ltd. During the internship, I created a website of a Shopping Cart
                in which the user can view the products available online and can add to the cart if he/she wishes to
                buy them and even remove it from the cart after looking the bill. On the other side, the admin can
                add new products, by filling a simple form. In this project, I learned the use of various front-end
                technologies such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and back-end technologies such as PHP, XML and
                AJAX and had my first practical experience in creating a full-fledged project. Also, My-SQL database
                was used to store the products in the database.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am enjoying while learning to code with Face Prep's Pro Grad program Front End Web Development
                bootcamp.
            </p>

                    This project creates a graphical interface, which, for our application, is a car as an

                    object comes near the ultrasonic sensor, the distance between the object and
                    ultrasonic sensor can be visually viewed on the screen which would be placed at the
                    front and if the object crosses a particular distance limit, a beep sound would be
                    heard which will warn the driver that the obstacle is going to hit the car. The distance
                    of the car from the wall is recorded on the Arduino IDE. It is cost efficient as there is no
                    need of a camera to be fitted.

                    algorithm. The data is visualized using a heat map which is easier to monitor the
